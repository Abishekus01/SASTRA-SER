    <h2>🎯 Purpose of the Project</h2>

    <p>
        Detecting human emotions has become an important strategy in today’s intelligent
        and personalized systems. Understanding a person’s emotional state allows systems
        to adapt their responses to better suit individual needs and preferences.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this project, we aim to detect a person’s emotions using <strong>speech signals</strong>
        alone, enabling emotion-aware AI applications. Speech Emotion Recognition can be
        applied in several real-world scenarios such as call centers, where calming music
        or responses can be provided when a user is angry, or smart vehicles, which can
        adjust driving behavior when the driver shows signs of stress or fear.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, this application has significant potential in areas such as
        <strong>human–computer interaction, customer experience, safety systems, and
        intelligent automation</strong>, benefiting both organizations and end users.
